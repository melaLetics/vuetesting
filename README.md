# testing

``` bash
!!! DO NOT AVOID TESTING BECAUSE IT JUST TAKES TOO MUCH TIME
!!! DO NOT FEAR WRITING TESTS


* Test only output that is dynamically generated
* Test only output that is part of the component contract (what is the purpose of the component?)
```

## Build Setup

# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
